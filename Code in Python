Assumptions:

-The given set of words that indicate racial slurs is a list of strings.
-A sentence is considered as a sequence of characters separated by a punctuation mark.
-The degree of profanity for a sentence is the percentage of words in the sentence that match with the set of words that indicate racial slurs.
